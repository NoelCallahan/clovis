Do you be concerned that your indoor cat is not getting enough exercise? While it holds true that cats have the evolutionary advantage of a high metabolism that works even as they lounge around ( observe lions in the wild ), they do still need some physical activity to keep them from a sedentary existence of sloth and eventual obesity.

Unlike dogs, cats cannot be hitched to the end of a leash and taken for a stroll around the neighborhood -- well, some can, but they need to be qualified from kitten-hood. It may take a little imagination, along with some trial and error, but you can find ways to encourage your cat to be more active. Playing with your cat can be a great type of encouragement. All it takes is a few creative ideas to keep your cat entertained and active!

#### Why Should Your Cat Exercise?

Activity is good for our pets. Activities help maintain a healthy body weight and keep the muscle tissue toned and strong, and keep the mind alert and active as well. Exercise is also fun and can provide us opportunities to bond with our pets. There are numerous methods for getting your cat even more involved in play, plus they don’t take enough time, money, or work on your part.

Based on your cat’s age group, weight, temperament, and passions, you might be able to create a location where your cat may romp about and climb. Cat trees and scratching articles are suitable for this sort of activity. In case you are helpful with equipment, you can build your very own cat jungle fitness center, or you'll find one at your neighborhood pet supply shop or on the web. If your cat is normally reluctant, you may want to get more mixed up in festivities.

You should try to invest about 10-15 minutes several times every day engaging your cat in a few sort of activity. Little cats and kittens will most likely consider the initiative in engaging you in enjoy, or they'll find their very own entertainment. Young cats have a tendency to be conveniently amused and can probably want to keep to play long once you've tired of the overall game.

Older and over weight cats are a small tougher to engage. They often don’t have the stamina or interest in expanded playtime, but will still reap the benefits of short activities during the day. If you have among the latter, start with a few momemts at a time, several times a day. When you have found a thing that engages your cat’s curiosity, try different variations of this activity, slowly but surely increasing enough time you spend playing.

#### How Accurately to Play with a Cat: Tips for Creative Activity

Actions that stimulate a cat’s organic hunting instincts are often the best bet. Small motorized remote controlled and battery powered furry mice are great for getting a cat’s attention. Actually the economical non-motorized mice are appealing; you will just have to do all the mock mouse motions utilizing a string that is attached to the mouse. Along the same collection, feather toys are good bird replicas, and are often attached to the end of a stick or string so that you can mimic the motions of a wounded bird, one of a cat’s favorite objects for stalking (your cat should never have access to feather toys without supervision, however , as they can be very dangerous if swallowed). And everyone knows how much kittens love a simple size of yarn. A piece of solid ribbon, shoelace or yarn can be wiggled across the ground or beneath a closed door (with you on one side of the door and the cat on the additional ) just out from the cat’s reach.

A lot of cats will grow out of this fascination with string as they age, but not all of them do. It wouldn’t hurt to try with your older cat. Just remember to put the string and ribbons aside after the games. Many an emergency intestinal blockage could have been avoided if the string had not been left out for the cat to swallow.

Another favorite is the beam of light. If you already have a smallish flashlight, you can try to get your cat to chase it around. Laser tips are even better, since the small beam of light appears to be a little bug, and cats love to chase bugs. Stay low with the light, or you may have your cat trying to climb the shelves to catch it and end up with broken knick-knacks on the floor. Also, become sure to avoid flashing the beam directly into your cat’s eyes.

Keep the fun novel for your cat by trying stuff you already have around the house. Empty boxes with holes slice into them make great "caves" and scratching toys, and crumpled paper, especially the tissue type that makes lots of noise, is great for batting around. Paper hand bags are fun for crawling into, too, but avoid the plastic hand bags; you don’t need to risk an accidental suffocation. Also: plastic rings, empty wc paper and paper towel rolls, stuffed animals, etc . You need to be cautious none of family members "toys" may become choking hazards.

Scratching articles and cat trees entice cats to climb, which uses their muscle tissues and naturally wears straight down the factors of their claws. Should you have the space, create a cat obstacle training course in your own home to ensure that your cat can leap from spot to destination to reach another perch. There are pre- produced shelving systems that you could find on the web, or you can create a system of your, with shelves that move from the ground to the ceiling in a stage pattern. Some individuals will put in a wrap-around ceiling-high shelf therefore their cats can climb and leap completely up to look for a good place where they can view over their kitty kingdom. Should you have a lawn, you can build or purchase an outdoor enclosure which allows your cat the benefit of getting outside without the hazards of traffic and various other animals.

Finally, if your cat actually must lose some weight, now there are exercise wheels -- just like the wheels designed for hamsters -- made simply for cats. Exercise tires do not consider up much space, plus they allow cats to perform and set you back their heart’s content.

With some imagination and a committed action to invest at least a combined hour every day on your own cat’s activity, you will see that both you as well as your cat are savoring a wholesome and more joyful life.
