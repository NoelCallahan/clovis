Women that are pregnant would have that healthful glow, but there are lots of skin problems that may also accompany motherhood. From hormonal pimples to stretchmarks and everything among, it helps to learn the intricacies of pregnancy skincare. With each child I learned a bit more about which items were better to use ( and steer clear of! ) and which foods to consume to help my epidermis cope with the issues miracle of pregnancy.

### Is Pregnancy Skincare Different?

The answer to that is it depends. It’s always smart to give the skin we have the care and interest it requires, especially during being pregnant when the body undergoes so many adjustments. The key is to select safe, nourishing ingredients that are healthy for both mom and baby.

There are certain things that generally make it onto my Simply no list, whether I’m pregnant or not. Basic and natural are greatest in my book. There are some things that even conventional professionals tell avoid during being pregnant though.

#### Retinol (Vitamin A)

This synthetic type of vitamin A is applied topically to your skin, usually to fight wrinkles and aging. Relating to professionals just like the National Institutes of Wellness, synthetic vitamin A health supplements are known to trigger birth defects. The dangers mean it will also be prevented topically when pregnant.

Retinol also gets a poor rap from the EWG (Environmental Working Group) Skindeep Database, which rates it as a 9 out of 10 for toxicity. This one can be tricky since it is often found in natural skincare products.

#### Salicylic Acid

Hormone changes during pregnancy can cause adult acne. Salicylic acid is used to dry up acne, though personally it didn’t work for my teen breakouts. When ingested it could trigger miscarriage or birth defects, so it’s recommended in order to avoid using it topically for pimples during pregnancy.

#### Other Chemicals

As the two above are just something to consider during pregnancy, there are numerous of problematic ingredients in conventional skincare products ( and just why I make a lot of my own). Based on the Environmental Functioning Group, a few of the elements to consider on labels and prevent are:

- “Fragrance” ( frequently contains phatalates, hormone-disrupting plasticizers that your company is not needed to disclose)
- DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea, imidzaolidinyl urea, and quaternium-15 (formaldehyde releasers)
- Propyl-, isopropyl-, butyl-, and isobutyl-parabens (mimics estrogen in your body )
- Methylisothiazolinone, methylchloroisothiazolinone and benzisothiazolinone (preservatives)

Taking care of the skin we have is always essential, but being pregnant presents its challenges. This following section covers the very best pregnancy skin issues and how specifically to fix them naturally.

#### Stretchmark Prevention and Treatment

After six pregnancies I’ve earned my tiger stripes, but that doesn’t mean I wish to keep them. Stretchmarks are thought to be genetic, however they could be diminished or actually eliminated. The main element to staying away from them or eliminating stretch marks can be a healthy diet plan and proper skincare.

Here are a few natural pregnancy skincare techniques for avoiding or fading stretchmarks:

- Consume healthy fats to give skin the fat-soluble vitamins it needs for suppleness.
- Drink bone broth, eat pastured meats, and work pure, grass-fed collagen supplements into smoothies or soups to help repair damaged skin.
- Consume lots of vitamin C, which is necessary for collagen production in the body. (Interesting fact: Bell peppers have significantly higher amounts than oranges).
- Apply calendula-infused oil liberally to the stomach to diminish stretch marks and C-section scars.
- This homemade pregnancy stretch mark salve (along with diet ) helped me get rid of mine.
- Spend regular time in the sun, as the natural vitamin D can help the skin heal and repair.

#### Pregnancy Acne

Many women find that changing hormones during pregnancy also cause blemishes and acne. The key to getting rid of pregnancy acne is to balance the hormones, ideally before conception.

Ironically, pregnancy hormones helped improve my bad acne that I had since high school.

Here are some other skincare tips to keep pimples at bay:

- Taking a high-quality probiotic and addressing gut health is key.
- Use a raw honey face wash. The anti-microbial, nourishing, and moisturizing honey helps keep skin clear and clean.
- Add a drop or two of tea tree essential oil to 1 1 tablespoon full- fat yogurt or honey and apply to the face. Rinse off after 10 minutes.
- Use a natural konjac sponge for gentle exfoliation.
- A purifying mask with bentonite clay and charcoal helps to draw impurities from the skin.

#### Pregnancy Mask (Melasma)

Hormonal changes during pregnancy can not only bring acne to a head, but they can cause the skin to darken. Light brown splotches may appear on the face and neck. Some women also get a dark line called linea nigra that runs down the center of the stomach.

Instead of using chemical whitening agents on the skin, a safer option is to balance the hormones. This includes eating a real food diet with healthy fats, grass-fed meat, grass-fed dairy (if tolerated) and plenty of healthy veggies. It’s a wise idea to skip out on the sugary foods and enjoy natural sweeteners like natural honey in tight moderation.

- Melasma is certainly irritated by sunlight exposure, so a secure sunscreen can help. Just be certain to get more than enough sun! A report from the University of Michigan implies that prenatals don’t supply sufficient vitamin D. Oxygen and old-fashioned sunshine is among the most effective methods for getting vitamin D amounts up.
- Raw honey might help with dark areas on the skin.
- Lemon juice works as a natural epidermis lightener, but ought to be used at least 12 hours before sun publicity.
- Stability hormones with a healthy diet plan, and avoid poisons and endocrine disruptors.
- A 2013 article released in the Indian Online Dermatology Journal highlights that enough supplement C also reverses epidermis hyperpigmentation. Bell peppers and camu powder are saturated in this antioxidant supplement, or see these different ways to supplement supplement C.

#### Red or Flushed Skin

Blood quantity doubles during pregnancy that may trigger some coloration in your skin. A rosy complexion could be why females are thought to “glow” in being pregnant, but inflammation isn’t what we’re after. This won’t most likely resolve until after birth and blood volume returns to normal, so until then makeup can help temper the color.

I like to whip up my own makeup though since it’s cheaper and simple.

- Natural concealer: Adding green pigment will help to combat skin redness. ( Those with very fair skin though should go easy on the green, or skin may look orange instead. )
- Liquid foundation: I love this foundation recipe, and it’s a cinch to mix up once you have the ingredients on hand ( thank you 1-click shopping…)
- Powder foundation: Applying powder foundation last gives extra coverage and a lasting finish.

#### Dry, Itchy Skin

Skin that’s stretching tighter over a blooming belly is prone to itchiness. Drinking bone broth, taking vitamin C, and adding a grass-fed collagen health supplement to the dietary plan will help.

- Use an all natural lotion daily after showering to keep epidermis supple and itch-free.
- Continue on fluids and steer clear of dehydrating or sugary choices. Crimson raspberry leaf tea assists tone the uterus for a shorter labor, and rooibos tea is certainly caffeine-, tannin-, and oxalate- free of charge unlike dark or green teas.
- Try eliminating dairy or having just grass-fed dairy (if tolerated).

#### Varicose and Spider Veins

That is a common complaint after pregnancy and a significant part of pregnancy skincare. Based on the American Being pregnant Association, the fat of the uterus pressing down causes elevated strain on the leg veins. This pressure could cause veins to bulge or convert dark. The hormone progesterone relaxes the vein wall space and the increased bloodstream quantity bogs vein function down even more. Standing for long periods of time, crossing legs, or carrying excess weight can worsen varicose veins, so try these things to counter it:

- Elevate the legs as able.
- Wear compression hose.
- Apply witch hazel topically over spider veins.
- Cold water remedy helps to boost circulation and decrease swelling for improved vein function. A 1992 study published in Phlebology: The Journal of Venous Disease exposed that individuals treated with cold water remedy saw vital improvement in varicose veins compared to the control group.
- After pregnancy, drink natural tea. Rosemary Gladstar offers fabulous vein-improving quality recipes in her book, Herbal Quality recipes for Vibrant Health.
- Dry brushing for some moments after a shower helps boost circulation and may fight cellulite too.
