If you have cats, it’s pretty hard never to be filled with like and adoration for the fluffy little weirdos. Cats are perfect companions, but it’s hard to deny that they’re quirky in the strangest methods, and you wouldn’t become alone if you occasionally wondered if your cat is in fact an alien disguised as an pet on earth.

Even though many bizarre cat habits are inoffensive, a few of them could be annoying to cope with. Imagine if we informed you there’s grounds behind why cats perform the weird issues they perform? By understanding your cat’s inspiration and their inherent character, it becomes simpler to handle a few of their habits that may be creating you a headaches. Here are some explanations why cats perform those unusual cat things they like to do:

#### WHY CATS ALWAYS MAKE AN EFFORT TO DRINK YOUR WATER

Most cat owners may relate to the knowledge of their feline friend desperately wanting to sneak sips from their drinking water cups - even though there’s a plate of fresh water sitting down nearby. It’s not really the worst part of the globe, but it’s not necessarily fun to constantly become shooing your cat aside either. Well, did you know there’s grounds why cats frequently want to beverage any water aside from bowl that’s been ready for them?

A peek into cat psychology provides some answers. Cats are organic hunters, and if indeed they got grown up in the open rather then your home, you can bet they’d be living off the land, eating prey that they hunt and kill themselves. Well, when you kill something and dismember it, what happens? A mess, that’s what. If there was water near their kill, cats would avoid drinking it for fear of contamination. Despite the fact that they eat their prey raw, they still have an instinct for what is safe and unsafe to eat, and apparently, they don’t like whatever might leak into the water.

So let’s go back to the household setting. If a cat’s water bowl is usually right next to their food, it activates those associations that are built into their instinct - they may seem the water as contaminated since their “kill” is usually in the food bowl right next to it. This results in them avoiding that water, so they try to drink out of any other water source they can find, like your cup. Want your cat to drink more? Place their water a fair distance away from their food and see what happens!

#### WHY CATS LIKE TO BE UP HIGH

If you’re a cat owner, a prudent move is to have cat furniture that allows them to get up high and survey their surroundings. Cats love getting up high, and if you haven’t made these accommodations for them, you may be driven crazy by them attempting to jump through to shelves and home furniture that you’re attempting to keep them from.

In the open, cats are apex predators who are also prey. That is an exclusive distinction, because so many animals are each one or the various other. Cats are a few of the most effective killing machines in character, but they’re also little, producing them targets for larger animals such as for example coyotes and wolves. This trait clarifies a whole lot of their behaviors, such as for example being up high.

Cats in the open like to climb high since it keeps them safe and sound from their normal predators, but it addittionally gives them a good view of potential prey below. This is another habit that’s baked into their instinct, so even though there’s nothing threatening them in your humble little home, you can bet they still enjoy climbing up to a vantage point and watching over their kingdom. If you don’t yet have a high cat tree, we recommend obtaining at least one.

#### WHY CATS ARE NATURALLY LITTERBOX TRAINED

Unlike the other two factors, this natural quirk of cats is a boon to owners, not really a burden. One great trait they virtually all talk about is their inclination to do all their business in the litterbox, without also being trained. For some cats, the one thing you must do is just show them where in fact the litterbox is, and lots of situations, you don’t even should do that - cats possess a great way of learning where they would like to pee, and the litterbox may be the answer nearly every time.

How come this? Well, it dates back to what we stated before about getting predator and prey. In the open, cats need to view their backs, because despite the fact that they’re lean mean eliminating machines, they may also be bested by larger pets. So to keep themselves alive, they act like ninjas, moving silently and concealing their footprint wherever they go. A major part of this is definitely covering up their waste - cat pee is the opposite of aromatic, reeking of ammonia in the worst ways, and their stool also generates a strong scent. So what do they do to cover their tracks? They bury it.

This, again, is definitely something that’s deeply rooted in their instincts. You’ll notice that when a litterbox is definitely unavailable (or exceedingly filthy), cats hardly ever just pee on a hard floor. They’ll usually find something that can provide makeshift cover, such as a pile of clothes, a bin of LEGO items, or your favorite blanket. So what’s the lesson here for pet owners? Make sure their litterbox is usually readily available and sufficiently clean! So long as those a couple of things are true, you almost certainly won’t have to get worried about potty issues in the house.
